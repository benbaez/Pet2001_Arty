A Commodore PET in an Artix-7 FPGA.

This is the source code for a Xilinx Vivado project targeting a Digilent
Arty FPGA evaluation board.

After cloning this repository, start Vivado and go to the TCL console and
type "cd <path-to-repository>" to move to the top directory of this repository.
Then type "source project.tcl".  Vivado will create a project within the
repository under the directory "Pet2001_Arty".  The project source code
will remain outside the project in the "src" directory so it can be under
source control.

At this point, you should be able to generate the bitstream from within
Vivado by clicking "Generate Bitstream" under the "Program and Debug" section
of the Project Manager.

Once the bitstream is generated, you should be able to use the Hardware
Manager to open the target and program the device with the bitstream.

(In some earlier versions of Vivado, the hardware manager needed to be given
the pathname of the bitstream.  The bitstream can be found at:
<path-of-repository>/Pet2001_Arty/Pet2001_Arty.runs/impl_1/Pet2001_Arty.bit
After the first time programming the device, the Hardware Manager will
remember this file location.)

This project has been updated to use Digilent's PmodVGA PMOD board instead
of composite video.  I have not updated the web page.  The PMOD board goes
into PMOD's JA and JB.

This project has been changed and now uses a PS/2 keyboard for input.
With the previous UART to keyboard conversion, I could not play games
because there was no way to know how long a key is held.  A PS/2 keyboard
interface needs to be hooked up to PMOD JD.  Also, cassette input and
output is sent to PMOD JC as well as CB2 sound.

Let me know if you have any trouble.
